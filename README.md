## About Me

üëã Hello! I'm **Jawahar Ramis**, a master's student with a deep passion for data engineering and analytics. I find joy in transforming raw data into meaningful insights, and my journey in the realm of data has been an exciting exploration.

### üöÄ What I Do

In my academic pursuit, I am currently enrolled in a master's program, specializing in Computer Science and Systems Engineering. Beyond the classroom, I have been actively involved in personal projects focusing on various data engineering topics. I thrive on the challenges of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, finding the journey of moving and reshaping data both fascinating and rewarding.

### üí° Why Data?

My enthusiasm for working with data stems from a genuine curiosity about the stories it can tell. I believe that every dataset has a narrative waiting to be uncovered, and I am dedicated to deciphering these narratives through the lens of data engineering and analysis.

### üå± Always Learning

I consider myself a perpetual learner. The dynamic nature of the data world motivates me to stay updated with the latest technologies and industry trends. I am not just satisfied with what I know; I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set, embracing new tools and methodologies to enhance my capabilities.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Landscape

Proficient in ETL processes and data manipulation techniques, I enjoy the challenge of orchestrating seamless data flows. My toolbox includes Python, SQL, Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, AWS and I am always excited to add more tools to my arsenal.

### üìà Let's Connect!

I am enthusiastic about connecting with fellow data enthusiasts, professionals, and anyone interested in the transformative power of data. If you share a passion for data engineering or have insights to share, let's connect and explore the endless possibilities that data has to offer.

Feel free to reach out, whether it's to discuss data projects, share knowledge, or simply exchange ideas. The journey of uncovering insights from data is always more enjoyable when it's a collaborative effort!
